Tanks-With-GUI
==============

  This is a version of my command line tanks game that adds a GUI using the SFML game library for C++. This is a work in progress: some of my previous code doesn't really work to great with some of the new things I have to add. I still plan on working on this project, but right now it is on the backburner. The game generates random terrain, and displays it on the screen. Pressing the spacebar will generate new terrain. There is a lag in responsiveness immediately after pressing the spacebar which is the first issue I will need to address when I make it back to this project.

Note: This application requires the SFML game library to run. If you are not familiar with SFML, it is basically a more modern version of SDL. It is not as widely supported, and does not run as close to the hardware as SDL, but it is a little more inutitive, and is based on Object Oriented concepts, making it easy to grasp and understand.
